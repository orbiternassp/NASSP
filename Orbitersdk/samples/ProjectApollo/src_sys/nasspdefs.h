// Define Doxygen groups. These just need to be documented in one place.
//
// Be sure to define them in the order you want them listed in the doxygen output.
//

///
/// \defgroup AGC Apollo Guidance Computer code.
/// \ingroup InternalSystems
/// \brief This code supports the Apollo Guidance Computers on the CSM and LEM.
///

///
/// Flagword definitions as used by the real AGC software. These are really intended 
/// for future expansion as the AGC simulation gets closer to the real thing.
/// For the moment only a few of these flags are actually used.
///
/// Note that some flags marked as unused weren't used on the real AGC but are used to
/// store new flags for the C++ AGC.
///
/// See the Apollo 15 Delco manual for full explanations of what these flags are used
/// for in the real AGC.
///
/// \defgroup AGCFlags Apollo Guidance Computer flag words.
/// \ingroup AGC
/// \brief Flagword definitions for the Apollo Guidance Computers on the CSM and LEM.
///

///
/// Bit definitions for the AGC I/O channels to simplify conversion between channel values
/// and function.
///
/// \defgroup AGCIO Apollo Guidance Computer I/O channels.
/// \ingroup AGC
/// \brief I/O definitions for the Apollo Guidance Computers on the CSM and LEM.
///

///
/// \defgroup Astronauts Astronaut code.
/// \brief This code supports the astronauts, lunar rover, etc.
///

///
/// \defgroup AstronautSettings Astronauts settings.
/// \ingroup Astronauts
/// \brief This code supports setting the state of astronaut DLLs.
///

///
/// \defgroup Sound Audio support.
/// \brief Code to support audio playback, either directly through DirectSound indirectly
/// through OrbiterSound.
///

///
/// \defgroup Config Configuration code.
/// \brief Scenario configuration code.
///

///
/// \defgroup ScenarioState Scenario state flags.
/// \ingroup Config
/// \brief Flags for scenario state.
///
/// For simplicity we pack various scenario flags into unions which combine bitfields and 32-bit ints.
/// As a result we only need to save the int value to the scenario file, and when we load it we automatically
/// get all the individual flags without bothering to extract them manually from the int or save and load each
/// flag individually.
///
/// For backwards compatibility, if you remove any of these flags, change its value to 'unusedX' where X is
/// an appropriate number to be unique in the structure; that way old scenarios won't break when we load the
/// old value.
///

///
/// \defgroup FailFlags Failure flags.
/// \ingroup ScenarioState
/// \brief Collection of flags used to specify failures during the mission.
///

///
/// \defgroup Connectors Connector code.
/// \brief This code is used to connect different objects together.
///

///
/// \defgroup PanelItems Control panel code.
/// \brief Objects which are used to support the control panel.
///

///
/// \defgroup DLLsupport DLL support.
/// \brief Objects and structures related to basic DLL support.
///

///
/// \defgroup Ground Ground support vehicle code.
/// \brief This code is for the ground support (ML, VAB, etc).
///

///
/// \defgroup InternalSystems Internal systems simulation.
/// \brief Objects which are used to simulate internal systems.
///

///
/// \defgroup DSKY Display/Keyboard code.
/// \ingroup InternalSystems
/// \brief This code supports the Apollo DSKY emulation.
///

///
/// \defgroup InternalInterface Interface to the internal systems code.
/// \ingroup InternalSystems
/// \brief General interface support for the internal systems.
///
/// This group contains functions, classes and structures used by general code to query the state of
/// internal systems without having to call the Panel SDK code directly. This is the preferred method
/// of querying state so that the low-level Panel SDK code can be revised without any changes to the
/// high-level code which makes use of the systems state information.
///
/// In general we've tried to put all related state into a single structure so that you can retrieve
/// it all in one call rather than having to make multiple calls for each system. This means, for
/// example, that the Caution and Warning system can retrieve the entire state of a spacecraft system
/// in one call and then check whether it should warn about that state (high/low voltage/pressure, etc).
///

///
/// \defgroup InternalSystemsState Internal systems state code.
/// \ingroup InternalSystems
/// \brief State variables for the internal systems.
///

///
/// \defgroup LVSystems Launch vehicle systems code.
/// \ingroup InternalSystems
/// \brief Simulation of systems specific to the launch vehicle (e.g. the Saturn Instrument Unit).
///

///
/// \defgroup PanelSDK Panel SDK code.
/// \ingroup InternalSystems
/// \brief The Panel SDK performs low-level simulation of the physical hardware.
///

///
/// \defgroup Propulsion Spacecraft propulsion systems code.
/// \ingroup InternalSystems
/// \brief Simulation of systems for and supporting spacecraft propulsion.
///

///
/// \defgroup LEM LEM vehicle code.

/// \brief This code supports separated stages of the Saturn launch vehicles and CSM.
///

///
/// \defgroup SepStageSettings Separated stage settings.
