  *	$Log$
  *	Revision 1.226  2007/12/21 09:38:43  jasonims
  *	EMS Implementation Step 5 - jasonims :   SCROLL: complete:  possible inaccuracy in velocity integration.   RSI: complete:  accurate readings, but unsure of authenticity of method, (lack of documentation found).    THRESHOLD CIRCUITRY:  complete: seems quite accurate.   CORRIDOR VERIFICATION: complete: needs testing, but appears to be correct.    RANGE:  working but inaccurate:  probable inaccuracy in range integration....unknown cause.   EMS State is saved as well.    Testing must insue.
  *	
  *	Revision 1.225  2007/12/05 19:49:55  tschachim
