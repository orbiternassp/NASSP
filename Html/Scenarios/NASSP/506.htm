performed various housekeeping functions, a voice and telemetry test, and an
oxygen purge system check. LM functions and consumables checked out well.

computer overload, but it was determined that it was safe to continue the
landing. The crew checked the handling qualities of the LM at 102:41:53 and
switched to automatic guidance ten seconds later. The landing radar switched to
“lowscale” at 102:42:19 as the LM descended below 2,500 feet altitude. The LM
was maneuvered manually 1,100 feet down range from the preplanned landing point
during the final 2.5 minutes of descent. The final alarm occurred at 102:42:58,
followed by the red-line low-level fuel quantity light at 102:44:28, just 72

translate beyond the rough terrain area.</p>

was opened at 109:07:33 and the commander exited at 109:19:16. While descending
the LM ladder, he deployed the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly from the
descent stage. A camera in the module provided live television coverage as he
descended. The commander’s left foot made first contact with the lunar surface
at 02:56:15 GMT on 21 July (22:56:15 EDT on 20 July) at 109:24:15. His first
words on the lunar surface were, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap

camera on its tripod in position to view the subsequent surface extravehicular
operations.</p>

margin-left:-.25pt'>The Apollo 11 mission, including a piloted lunar landing
and surface exploration, was conducted with skill, precision, and relative
ease. The excellent performance of the spacecraft in the preceding four
missions and the thorough planning in all aspects of the program permitted the
safe and efficient execution of this mission. The following conclusions were
made from an analysis of post-mission data:</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
effectiveness of pre-mission training was reflected in the skill and precision
with which the crew executed the lunar landing. Manual control while
maneuvering to the desired landing point was satisfactorily exercised.</p>
