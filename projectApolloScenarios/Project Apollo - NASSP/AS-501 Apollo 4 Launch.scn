The Saturn V makes its first flight to test itself and carry an unmanned CSM into orbit on Nov 9 1967. This mission is fully computer-controlled, flying a pre-programmed launch, 'TLI' and re-entry trajectory.

While not a perfect simulation, this does give a basic idea of what happened on the flight.
